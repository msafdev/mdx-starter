```

```

## 🧠 Frontmatter

Declare metadata at the top of the file:

```mdx
---
title: "My MDX Post"
date: 2025-05-23
tags: ["mdx", "blog"]

---
```

## 🪄 Extras & Tips

- Escape characters with \`\\\` (e.g., \\\*not italic\\\*)
- Nest content inside custom components for layout control
- Combine Tailwind CSS and MDX for powerful design
- You can even use conditional rendering in your MDX!

```jsx
{true && <p>This is conditionally rendered JSX!</p>}
````
